## What is this Project ?

The concept behind this app is to apply and put an interface to manipulate the data coming from the [Todo Management - Backend](https://github.com/celsodasecond/todo-mngt-backend). 

**NOTE:** This project is not mobile responsive and only works best for web/desktop platforms ðŸ’».
**ANOTHER NOTE:** The file structure of this project is wrong especially with the usage of the components folder. Whole pages must be put into a separate 'pages' folder for better separation of concerns. Again, the sole purpose of this app is have an interface from the backend.

## Development

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
